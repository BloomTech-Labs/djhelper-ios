DJ Helper is a tool used for planning the music playlist at an event. Whether it's a gettogether with a few friends, a party with many guests, or a large gathering such as a wedding, DJ Helper makes the music selection a fun and social process for all involved.

The person orgaining the playlist can get things started by putting a few songs on a playlist and then sending a link to guests to get additional song requests.  Guests can see the playlist, request songs of their own, and see requests submitted by other guests. If the guest sees a song they like on the request list, they can click to upvote that song. Sorting by upvotes, the playlist organizer can easily see which songs would be most enjoyed by their guests.  Based on songs requested, DJ Helper can also recommend similar songs to give the host an even better chance on making a playlist that will delight their guests.

### Authentication API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things A little happy sunlight shining through there. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

### Payment API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

This is the way you take out your frustrations. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.

### Misc API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

You can do anything your heart can imagine. In life you need colors. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.

### Misc API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

### Misc API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. You can spend all day playing with mountains. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. It's cold, but it's beautiful.
