DJ Helper is a tool used for planning the music playlist at an event. Whether it's a gettogether with a few friends, a party with many guests, or a large gathering such as a wedding, DJ Helper makes the music selection a fun and social process for all involved.

The person organizing the playlist can get things started by putting a few songs on a playlist and then sending a link to guests to get additional song requests.  Guests can see the playlist, request songs of their own, and see requests submitted by other guests. If the guest sees a song they like on the request list, they can click to upvote that song. Sorting by upvotes, the playlist organizer can easily see which songs would be most enjoyed by their guests.  Based on songs requested, DJ Helper can also recommend similar songs to give the host an even better chance on making a playlist that will delight their guests.
